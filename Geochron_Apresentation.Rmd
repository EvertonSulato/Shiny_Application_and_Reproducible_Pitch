## About the App

Use the **𝔾𝕖𝕠𝕔𝕙𝕣𝕠𝕟** app to determine the age (in years) of geological samples.

Set the Uranium (U), Thorium (Th) and Helium (He) concentration by inserting the value or moving the sliderbar.

The age result is shown on the display.

## Isotopic Age

Alpha particles are produced during the spontaneous desintegration of the ²³⁸U, ²³⁵U, and ²³²Th series radionuclides.

After capturing 2 electrons, these particles (alpha + 2e) form the Helium gas, which can accumulate over time.

## Use the App Online

The **𝔾𝕖𝕠𝕔𝕙𝕣𝕠𝕟** application allows for a quick obtaining of the age from the concentrations of U-Th/He analyses.

The app is available online. There is no need to install it.
